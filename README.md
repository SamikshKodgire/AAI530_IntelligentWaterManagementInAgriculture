🌱 IoT-Enabled Smart Soil Moisture Monitoring and Irrigation Decision Support System
📌 Project Overview

India is one of the world’s most agrarian economies, where many farmers rely on rainfall and traditional irrigation practices to manage crop water needs. These approaches often lead to inefficient water usage, over-irrigation, and reduced crop yields, particularly in water-stressed and semi-arid regions.

This project designs an IoT-enabled Smart Soil Moisture Monitoring and Irrigation Decision Support System that leverages real-world sensor data and machine learning to support data-driven irrigation decisions. The system monitors soil moisture levels, forecasts future moisture trends using time-series models, and provides actionable insights to optimize irrigation schedules.

🎯 Objectives

Design a theoretical end-to-end IoT system architecture for smart irrigation

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on soil moisture sensor data

Implement machine learning models, including time-series forecasting and deep learning

Visualize insights using a Tableau Public dashboard

Demonstrate practical application of IoT and ML concepts

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Soil Moisture Data from Field-Scale Sensor Network

Type: Real-world IoT sensor data

Description: Time-stamped soil moisture readings collected from multiple field-deployed sensors, forming a multivariate time-series dataset.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The project includes two primary machine learning tasks:

Time-Series Forecasting to predict future soil moisture levels using historical data

Deep Learning Analysis to support irrigation decision-making based on soil moisture patterns

Model performance is evaluated using appropriate regression and classification metrics.
